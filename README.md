# JustNinja Game

This is a simple tap game for iOS. Your mail goal is to help your ninja achieve his ultimate goal - become a .NET Ninja and get the Telerik Academy certificate. What stands in his way you may be asking? The answer: 

# Exams!!!

Our hero is running on a small bar towards his goal, but there are obstacles(TA exams) under the forms of walls. By tapping you move the hero up or down the bar in order to avoid the walls. If you bumb into one of them the game ends. With every wall(exam) passed the game gets harder by increasing the running speed of the ninja(because after taking the exam he is hungry for more knowledge)

# Highscores

The game has highscores. The further you get, the higher the score. After ending a game you can save your highscore to compare with other players. You can also view all highscores.

# Game functionalities:

- moving hero up and down with gesture
- opening highscores with gesture
- saving your current score(optional)
- reviewing all highscores saved by playesr(using Parse backend service)
- keeping track of your local best score(saved in Core Data)
- uploading photo and providing current location when saving highscore. That way other players can see where you are from and eventually how you look like.
- extending game so hero can jump over obstacles, and adding higher obstacles that cannot be jumped over (*only if I have time)
